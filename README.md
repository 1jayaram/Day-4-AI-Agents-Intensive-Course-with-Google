# Day 4 Agent Quality

During the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google, I explored Agent Quality by completing codelabs on Kaggle.

Day 4a - Agent Observability

Day 4b - Agent Evaluation

What I learnt during the 4th day,
1. Investigated quality assurance using logs, traces, and metrics for agent observability and evaluation.
2. Debugged agents and scored responses using LLM-as-a-Judge and Human-in-the-Loop evaluation frameworks.
3. Built monitoring and diagnostic systems to better understand agent decisions and failures.
